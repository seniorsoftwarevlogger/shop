      <h2>What&apos;s your return policy?</h2>
      <p>
        The products are being produced on demand, so we don&apos;t offer returns and exchanges, but if there&apos;s something
        wrong with your order, please let us know by contacting us at{" "}
        <a href="mailto:dima@seniorsoftwarevlogger.com">shop@seniorsoftwarevlogger.com</a>!
      </p>

      <h2>Do you offer refunds?</h2>
      <p>
        Refunds are only offered to customers that receive the wrong items or
        damaged items. If any of these apply, please contact us at{" "}
        <a href="mailto:dima@seniorsoftwarevlogger.com">shop@seniorsoftwarevlogger.com</a> with photos of wrong/damaged items and we&apos;ll
        sort that out for you.
      </p>

      <h2>Can I exchange an item for a different size/color?</h2>
      <p>
        At this time, we don&apos;t offer exchanges. If you&apos;re unsure which
        size would fit better, check out our sizing chartsâ€”we have one for every
        item listed on our store, in the product description section. Though
        rare, it&apos;s possible that an item you ordered was mislabelled. If
        that&apos;s the case, please let us know at{" "}
        <a href="mailto:dima@seniorsoftwarevlogger.com">shop@seniorsoftwarevlogger.com</a> within a week after receiving your order. Include your order
        number and photos of the mislabeled item, and we&apos;ll send you a new
        one, or issue a refund!
